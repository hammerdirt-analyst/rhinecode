### rhinecode

In this study, we provide the first international comparison of macrolitter pollution levels on the shores of rivers and lakes along one river system, the Rhine. We compare the quantities and composition of macrolitter found on the riverbank and lakeshores connected to the Rhine river basin in Switzerland and the Netherlands, for two seasons in 2017 and _to be decided_.  We identify the most prevalent macrolitter items found in the Rhine catchment, with the scope of informing public policies and action for effective waste reduction efforts. 

#### notebooks:

**haromonizecodes**: the preprocessing of the object identifiers from the two seperate projects and merging object identifiers to a common set.

**harmonizesurveyresults**: the preprocessing of survey results so that the results from both projecs are in the same format

#### initial harmonized results: Top ten objects Swiss versus Dutch rivers:
